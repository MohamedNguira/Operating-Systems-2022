When testing Round robin algorithm, it shows average turnaround and waiting times higher than the ones observed using shortest job first and first come, first served algorithms.
This is due to suspending a process while running and let it complete at another time. Performing this operation a lot will give a high waiting time since
most processes are going to take more than the quantum unit chosen to finish. The advantage of this algorithm is that very long processes won't block the execution
of the other processes.
