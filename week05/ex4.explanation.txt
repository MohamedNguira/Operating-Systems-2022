Real Process Time seems to be decreasing during the first 3 tests, but increases when the number of threads gets significantly higher.
This is due to the mutex locking we are doing which makes threads wait for more time for the unlocking to be done. We can also see a significant
increase in system time consumed for higher number of threads which is also due to the massive amounts of mutex calls we are performing in our program.
